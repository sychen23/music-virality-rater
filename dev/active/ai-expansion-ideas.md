# AI Expansion Ideas — Claude Code Hackathon

Ideas for deepening Claude's role in Soundcheck, organized by where they fit in the user journey.

## For Uploaders (Pre-Submit)

### AI Context Recommender
Before the user picks TikTok/Spotify/Radio/Sync, Claude analyzes the snippet description + tags and suggests which context the track would score best in, with reasoning ("your tempo and hook structure align well with TikTok trends").

### Snippet Selection Assistant
Analyze the waveform/audio characteristics and recommend the optimal 15-30s snippet window ("the energy peak at 0:22-0:45 would make the strongest TikTok hook").

### Virality Pre-Score
Give an AI prediction before community ratings come in, based on the track's characteristics. Users can later compare the AI prediction vs. actual community scores.

## For Raters (During Rating)

### AI as a Rater
Claude rates the track alongside humans on the same 4 dimensions, with written reasoning. Show the AI rating after the human submits theirs — creates a fun "do you agree with AI?" moment.

### Rating Calibration
After a rater submits, show how their rating compares to the AI's take and to the crowd average. Helps raters understand their own biases ("you tend to rate catchiness higher than average").

## For Results (Post-Rating)

### Competitive Landscape
"Here are 3 real songs with similar characteristics that went viral, and here's what they had that your track could add."

### Actionable Playbook
Go beyond insights to generate a concrete distribution strategy: "Post this snippet on TikTok at 6pm EST, use these hashtags, target these creator communities."

### Score Narrative
Instead of just showing numbers, generate a natural-language story of the track's rating journey ("Your track started polarizing — early raters were split on catchiness — but by vote 20, a consensus emerged...").

### Cross-Context Comparison
If a track was submitted to multiple contexts, Claude analyzes why it scored differently ("Your track's production quality carried it on Spotify Discover but the hook wasn't punchy enough for TikTok").

## Platform-Wide (New Features)

### AI-Powered Leaderboard Commentary
Weekly/daily AI-generated analysis of trending tracks and what they have in common.

### Genre/Trend Detection
Claude analyzes all recent submissions to identify emerging patterns and publishes a "what's hot" digest.

### Chat with Your Results
A conversational interface where uploaders can ask follow-up questions about their ratings ("Why did I score low on singability?" / "How can I improve my hook?").

### AI Battle Mode
Two tracks go head-to-head, Claude provides commentary like a music critic comparing them.

## Top 3 for Hackathon (highest impact, tight deadline)

1. **AI as a Rater** — Immediately doubles the AI presence, creates engagement, and is technically interesting (structured output on music dimensions)
2. **Chat with Your Results** — Showcases Claude's conversational strength and the large context window (feed it all ratings + dimensions + existing insights)
3. **Virality Pre-Score** — Creates a compelling before/after narrative (AI prediction vs. crowd reality)
